- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Cynog
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in High Performance Computing, Parallel Programming, CUDA, Numerics and much more
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my C++ skills, after working with C for way too long.
- ðŸ˜Š I'm quite proud of the two functions i wrote for the Arduino Uno to read and write from/to an external RAM found in my [arduino-extram](github.com/Cynog/arduino-extram) repository
