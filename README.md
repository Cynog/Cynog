- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Cynog!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in **High Performance Computing** (i.e. Parallel Programming using OpenMP and MPI, NVIDIA CUDA), **Numerics** (especially solvers and preconditioners for systems of linear equations), **Data Science**, **Machine Learning** and much more
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my C++ skills, after working with C for way too long
- ðŸ˜Š I'm quite proud of the [two functions i wrote](https://github.com/Cynog/arduino-extram/blob/main/lib_extram.hpp) for the Arduino Uno to read and write from/to an external RAM and of the [RAM efficient poisson solvers](https://github.com/Cynog/arduino-extram/blob/main/lib_poisson.cpp) for testing found in my [arduino-extram](https://github.com/Cynog/arduino-extram/) repository
